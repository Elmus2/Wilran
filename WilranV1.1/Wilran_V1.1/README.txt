This is my very first app and I'm a total noob at coding. Fair warning!

Welcome to Wilran! This is a wild Pokémon randomizer for the Dungeons and Dragons 5e system and using the rules from https://poke5e.app/


There are two parts to this. The first is the area builder.

The area builder will allow you to set up different areas (eg. Route 1, or Mnt Moon) and add the possible Pokémon and levels that might appear in that area.


The second is the main Wilran program. This will allow you to select your area and randomize a Pokémon that you set up from the area builder.

Wilran will do also the following after randomizing a Pokémon,
- Add a random nature and adjust ability scores
- Level up the Pokémon and adjust everything that come with it
- Randomly give it four moves from its list
- Give the Pokémon a 1 in 100 chance of being a shiny
- Give it a random available ability as well as show the hidden ability
- Give it a 1 in 4 chance of having a held item

You will then be able to add the randomized Pokémon into a tracker which *mostly* works. The tracker can be used to track hp, pp, make attack and damage rolls, make ability checks and saving throw, and skill checks.


I'm leaving my test areas.json in the file. Feel free to delete it as the as the area builder will create a new empty one. You can edit areas using the builder or manually from the json. Make sure you keep the formatting the same. 

helditems.json could also be edited directly if you don't like the items available for Pokémon to hold.
